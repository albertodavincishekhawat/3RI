    "1. **Classical Probability**:\n",
    "      > used when we assume **outcome of each sample space is equally likely**\n",
    "   - **Definition**: Based on the assumption that all outcomes in the sample space are equally likely.\n",
    "   - **Formula**: P(A) = Number of favorable outcomes/Total number of outcomes\n",
    "   - **Example**: The probability of getting heads when flipping a fair coin is 1/2.\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "      > ***Alternative defination***\n",
    "      - Classical probability is based on theoretical analysis and assumes that **all outcomes in a sample space are equally likely to occur**. \n",
    "      - The probability of an event A is the number of outcomes that favor A divided / total number of outcomes in the sample space. \n",
    "      - For example, **the probability of rolling a 1 on a standard die is 1/6**, and **the probability of rolling an even number on a standard die is 3/6 = 1/2**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Empirical (or Experimental) Probability**:\n",
    "      > used when we calculate **probablity by observing previously occurred experiments**.\n",
    "   - **Definition**: Based on observations or experiments.\n",
    "   - **Formula**: P(A) = Number of times event A occurs/Total number of trials\n",
    "   - **Example**: If you roll a die 100 times and the number 4 comes up 20 times, the empirical probability of rolling a 4 is \\( \\frac{20}{100} = 0.2 \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Subjective Probability**:\n",
    "      >probablity estimations based on subjective experience\n",
    "   - **Definition**: Based on personal judgment or experience, not on exact calculations or experiments.\n",
    "   - **Example**: A weather forecaster might say there's a 70% chance of rain tomorrow based on their experience and available data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Axiomatic Probability**: [Read for detail on \"Andrey Kolmogorov's axioms\" **Focus on conclusion section**](https://unacademy.com/content/jee/study-material/mathematics/three-axioms-of-kolmogorovs/)\n",
    "   - **Definition**: **Based on a set of axioms or rules**. This approach was developed by Russian mathematician **Andrey Kolmogorov**.\n",
    "   - **Axioms**:\n",
    "     1. The probability of an event is a non-negative number: **P(A)>= 0**.\n",
    "     2. The probability of the sample space is 1: **P(S) = 1**.\n",
    "     3. For any two mutually exclusive events A and B, the probability of their union is the sum of their probabilities: P(A Union B) = P(A) + P(B) if A and B are mutually exclusive.\n",
    "   - **Example**: Using these axioms, one can derive that the probability of the complement of an event A is P(A^c) = 1 - P(A).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Conditional Probability**:\n",
    "   - **Definition**: The probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred.\n",
    "   - **Formula**: \\( P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} \\) where \\( P(B) \\neq 0 \\).\n",
    "   - **Example**: The probability of drawing a red card from a deck of cards, given that the card drawn is a heart, is \\( \\frac{13/52}{1/4} = 1 \\) since all hearts are red.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Bayesian Probability**:\n",
    "   - **Definition**: A method of probability interpretation that updates the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.\n",

It tells you if everyone's apple count was pretty close to 20 or if they were all over the place.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Variance: \n",
    "    - Imagine if you were to measure on a scale of 1-10 how close each movie is to everyone's ideal movie preference. Then, you tried to find out how much each rating differs from the average. Summing up these differences (squared, to avoid negatives) and getting an average gives you the variance. It's like a numerical way of seeing how much individual movie ratings differ from the group's average taste.\n",

    "- Standard Deviation:\n",
    "    - This is like the trusty sidekick of variance. Think of it as the average difference from the mean, but in the original units.

It's super useful because it's easier to relate to the original data.\n",

    "- Coefficient of Variation:\n",
    "    - This is a relative measure. It’s like saying, \"Compared to how much everyone generally liked the movies, how varied were their preferences?\" It’s the standard deviation as a percentage of the mean, showing variability in relation to the average."
